Self-Healing Kernel
The Self-Healing Kernel Operating System is a small kernel that runs in 32-bit protected-mode to demonstrate basic operating system principles including task scheduling, reading input from hardware level, and automatic fault recovery. The kernel is written in C and x86 assembly language, runs directly on virtualized hardware using QEMU and loads through the GRUB bootloader. It supports output to VGA text mode, reading input through port-mapped I/O, and has a custom, kernel-level keyboard polling driver to allow user interaction without the need for interrupts. It runs with a three-task model to simulate different runtime behaviors, and will detect tasks that have crashed, as well as automatically respawn them.

There is an interactive menu which allows users to dynamically switch between Manual Mode - where users can make calls to explicitly restart tasks - and Automatic Mode - where the kernel constantly supervises and repairs tasks autonomously. The system has the ability to log events when tasks crash, and restart them through events that appear on the screen, so we can see the self-healing behavior clearly. The entire project, including source code, bootloader definition, build scripts and overall project documentation have been compiled into a bootable ISO format, as well as tested and run through QEMU, and have been also documented and uploaded to GitHub for academic submission and public development purposes.

Self-Healing System Simulator

The Self-Healing System Simulator is an efficient C-based program used to simulate the behavior of autonomous fault detection and recovery systems without the overhead of a full kernel environment. It simulates several independent tasks that temporarily execute periodic operations and includes failure states to simulate realistic crashes. Users can utilize the system in either Automatic Mode, automatically detecting and recovering from failures when they occur, or Manual Mode, where tasks can be re-initialized as required.

The simulator provides ample console output, structured logging, and a simplified interface to simulate how self-healing mechanisms work at a high level. The Self-Healing System Simulator is built for reliability and ease of testing, and it runs in normal desktop matters without the need for any specialized hardware or virtualization options. The full project, including source code and documentation, has been submitted to GitHub to ensure academic evaluation, collaboration, and future contributions.
